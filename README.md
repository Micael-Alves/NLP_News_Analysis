# NLP_News_Analysis
NLP analysis of the AGNews dataset using Spacy library and Neural Networks (Tensorflow).

The complete code is divided in 3 parts:

The part 1 contains: application of binary classifiers to the AG News datasets, model refinement, hyperparameter tuning and decision threshold experimentation

The part 2 contains: application of multiclass models to the AG News datasets and weights analysis of the model.

The part 3 contains: application of neural networks models in Tensorflow to AG News datasets (binary and multiclass classifiers).

In the "NLP_AG_News_report.pdf", you will find further details about the used algorithms as well as the results analysis.
